      <h2>Shadow casting experiment</h2>
      <p>The box shadows on this page act like they have a real light source.</p>

      <h2>What do I do?</h2>
      <p> Experiment by dragging the ☀️ around, and press up/down to adjust the intensity of the light. Sorry
        mobile users!</p>

    <div class="block solid" data-elevation="5">
      <h2>This element has an elevation of 5</h2>
      <p>What does 5 mean? It means it's 5 times higher up than 1.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block solid" data-elevation=".25">
      <h2>This element has an elevation of .25</h2>
      <p>That means the shadow is really tiny.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block solid">
      <h2>This box has the default elevation</h2>
      <p>Which happens to be "1" on the arbitrary scale I made up.</p>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>This element has no shadow</h2>
      <p>Only elements with the "solid" class are affected by this lighting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="long block solid inset" data-elevation=".33">
      <p>This element has an inset shadow with its own elevation. It's supposed to look like it's 'beneath' the page.
