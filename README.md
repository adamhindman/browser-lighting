Proof of concept where I'm rendering box shadows for HTML elements based on a light source. Render may be too fancy of a word for this.

## Ok

Yeah! ðŸ˜…

# How do I use it?

Give an element the `solid` class. That means it's solid, and can cast shadows. Other elements just don't cast shadows (unless you set them yourself in CSS) ðŸ‘»

If you also give it the `inset` class, it will cast shadows inside the box.

Use the `data-elevation="some number"` attribute to modify the elevation. 

# Is this something anyone will ever use?

I don't think so! I'm not even sure how you would.
